# Semen-Quality-Classification
## This research Uses a machine learning predictive model in predicting Semen Quality


Based on the results of this research, it appears that the use of SMOTE and Tomek links to oversample and undersample the target variable in the data was effective in balancing the dataset. The subsequent application of the chi-square test of independence and the Boruta algorithm did not identify any important variables, but the resulting logistic regression and support vector machine still achieved relatively high recall scores
